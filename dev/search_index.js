We can denote the set of robust chance nodes as a subset of chance nodes, formally hatCC Each robust chance node ihatC creates a number of path probability variables that is bounded by the factorial of the number states, formally O(S_i) The total number of path probability variables, which are linear variables and constraints, grows to the product of the factorials","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Obig(_ihatC S_ibig)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"However, the constant in factorial bound is less than one and in certain special cases, the bound is polynomial, which makes the distributionally robust model tractable when the number of states is reasonably small.
